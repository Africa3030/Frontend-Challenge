# Figma Modules: ColumnHeader & RowTable

This repository contains the **ColumnHeader** and **RowTable** components, originally designed in Figma and automatically converted to code using the [Anima plugin](https://www.animaapp.com/). Each component is available in two versions:

- **Modules**: Standard modular CSS-based components.
- **Tailwind**: Tailwind CSS-based components.

These resources are designed to assist in achieving **pixel-perfect** layouts for your project. However, using these componentsâ€”whether fully or partiallyâ€”is entirely optional.

## What is Anima?

[Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/) is a powerful design-to-code platform that simplifies the transition from design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to production-ready code. It enables designers and developers to:

- Export Figma designs into clean HTML, CSS, and React code.
- Create responsive designs with minimal effort.
- Accelerate development by bridging the gap between design and code.

By leveraging Anima, these components were exported with attention to preserving design fidelity and responsiveness.

## Usage Notes

- These components are **helpers** and may be used to expedite development. They are not required for implementing your project.
- You are free to modify, adapt, or ignore these resources as needed.
- Ensure that your final implementation aligns with the design requirements and functionality expectations, regardless of whether you use these components.

We hope these resources assist in making your workflow smoother and your layouts pixel-perfect! ðŸ˜Š
